<!-- On the industry side, I'm currently interning as a Software Engineer at Microsoft in Prague. I've also worked at ASML building visualization tools for microchip analysis, and at AI startups Rossum and Blindspot AI developing machine learning solutions for document processing and fraud detection. -->

<!-- When I'm not coding or researching, I love debating â€“ I had the chance to lead our debate club on campus at Delft. I'm also into rock music (Pink Floyd and Radiohead are my favorites) and I'm currently trying to learn guitar.  -->
