My friends usually call me VaÅ¡ek [vashek]. Iâ€™m originally from Czechia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿.

Iâ€™m currently pursuing an MSc in Advanced Computer Science at the **University of Oxford**, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. My research interests lie in embodied AI, computer vision and reinforcement learning.

Previously, I completed a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering at **TU Delft**, where I worked on research projects in model-based reinforcement learning, industrial robotics, and Bayesian neural networks.

Iâ€™ve interned as a Software Engineer at **Microsoft** and **ASML**, and as a Machine Learning Engineer at the startups **Rossum** and **Blindspot AI**.



<!-- On the industry side, I'm currently interning as a Software Engineer at Microsoft in Prague. I've also worked at ASML building visualization tools for microchip analysis, and at AI startups Rossum and Blindspot AI developing machine learning solutions for document processing and fraud detection. -->

<!-- When I'm not coding or researching, I love debating â€“ I had the chance to lead our debate club on campus at Delft. I'm also into rock music (Pink Floyd and Radiohead are my favorites) and I'm currently trying to learn guitar.  -->
